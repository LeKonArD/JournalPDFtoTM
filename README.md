# JournalPDFtoTM

Notice: This Repository is in a very early state of development.

This Repository contains Python-Scripts to convert academic Journals form PDF to plaintext for Topic Modelling.
The unique idea is to transform PDF to HTML and use Information about Layout to get structured Output. The mainfreatures
are splitting articles and separate text form foodnotes.

The Code is tested on the german journal "DVJS", but can fit other journals with sleigth changes in layout-parameters.

The second Task for this project is to convert TM-output from MALLET to XML and produce a easy to use visualization in 
eXist-DB to track the "Topics over Time Trends" in the journal-histrory.
